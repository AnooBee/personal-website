Blog to keep track of my AWS-SAA-C02 exam prep.
I've been meaning to break into the cloud world for a while now and dabbling with various cloud providers over the last few years and decided to formally have some form or certification. While I don't necessarily believe that certifications are useful by themselves, it certainly helps with getting into a mindset of learning in a formal, structured manner.

Once I decided to go down this path, I had to pick between the 3 big providers - AWS, Azure and GCP. While GCP was very intriguing and Azure is what will be used at work I figured AWS gives me the most breadth of knowledge for architecting software in the Cloud. It also helps that they are the market leader by a long mile and there are plenty of resources on the web to help with the certification.

Background with AWS: I've worked on and off with various AWS services using their free tier over the last few years and am pretty familiar with a lot of the basic services.

Once the decision to pursue AWS certification was made, I researched a bit on how others have approached the certification - quora, medium and reddit were my primary resources. The AWS Solutions Architect - Associate was the obvious certification based on my experience and interests.

The Ryan Kroonenburg course from A Cloud Guru was highly recommended along with Tutorials Dojo's Practice tests. I purchased both these off Udemy in the last week of February.
