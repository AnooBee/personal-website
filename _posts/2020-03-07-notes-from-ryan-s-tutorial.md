So, I finished Ryan's excellent tutorial on the AWS-SAA exam from Udemy. The entire tutorial is about 12.5 hours long splint into multiple lectures with an average length of approximately 10-12 mins. The longest labs were about 20 mins. I spent a couple of weekends and at least a couple of hours every day after work going through the videos. I also took a couple of days off at good stopping points to give myself a break.

I went through most of the videos at either 1.5x or 1.25x speed, especially the ones I was re-watching a second time to better understand. Also followed along with the videos during the lab sessions. This is vitally important because it helps with getting a better mental picture of the enormous AWS ecosystem.

As a side note, be sure to terminate all the services you create during labs because not everything is free. Found this out the hard way when I noticed a bill for $2 in the billing area for a gateway that I had created in a VPC that was not terminated. Also a good idea to set up billing notifications as soon as you create your free tier account. I set mine up to send an email when costs go above $0.1.
